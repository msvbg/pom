A communal pomodoro timer, so that your coworkers will never again
unwittingly disturb your flow -- because they'll be in it too.

# What?
[The Pomodoro Technique](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) is a popular method of staying productive. You work in bursts of 25 minutes, ignoring all distractions, while taking regular five minute breaks in order to avoid burnout. The system works great until you realize that your coworkers need to talk to you every once in a while. How do we circumvent this painful necessity of life?

`pom` lets everyone run their pomodoro cycles in sync, so that you take breaks at exactly the same time.

# Install
```sh
$ npm install -g pom-cli
```

# How to use
To start a pomodoro group, run `pom start <name>`. To sync up with a pomodoro
group, type `pom connect <name>`. Or just type `pom help` for a full breakdown
of what's possible with this magical tool.
